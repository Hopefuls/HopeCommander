# HopeCommander - the easy to use bungeecord command bridge for non-bungeecord plugins!
[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/hopefuls/hopecommander/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/hopefuls/hopecommander)

This plugin is mean't as an easy to use alternative for Plugins used in Networks that require Commands that can only be used on the Bungeecord Proxy.
## How to install:

 1. Download the Latest Release from [here](https://github.com/Hopefuls/HopeCommander/releases).
 2. Put the .jar file on **all** Spigot-Subservers (or only the ones you would need it on) and your Bungeecord Proxy.
 3. And you're done!
 
 ## How do i use it?
 The Plugin pretty much has only one Command, which can only be used as the Console, aka your non-bungeecord Plugins that are going to interact with it.
 
 In order to use this Plugin, you'll need to change the commands that should be executed on your Bungeecord Proxy to `/hcspigot <command>`, so for example if you're using [AdvancedBan](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advancedban.8695/) for example, you can easily use `/hcspigot ban <player> <reason>` while of course changing the corresponding `<player>` and `<reason>` with your plugin's placeholders if applicable.
